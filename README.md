## Overview

Charging Tracker is an Android application that helps you understand your device's charging habits.
By logging and analyzing charging sessions, it provides insights that can help you make more
informed decisions about how you charge your device, potentially extending battery lifespan.

## Features

* **Automatic Charging Session Logging:** The app automatically detects when your device starts and
  stops charging, recording the date, time, and duration of each session.
* **Battery Level Tracking:** Monitors the battery percentage throughout each charging session,
  providing a detailed history.
* **Charging Statistics:** Offers an overview of your charging behavior, including:
    * Total time spent charging
    * Average charging time per day/week/month
    * Frequency of charging sessions
* **Background Operation:** Uses foreground services to operate seamlessly in the background.
* **Data Persistence:** Stores charging data locally using a database.
* **Charging Speed:** Track how fast your phone is charging.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a clear and easy-to-understand overview of your charging
  data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Android Studio (latest stable version recommended).
* Android device or emulator running Android API level 24 or higher (as suggested by the use of
  modern libraries).
* Basic understanding of Android development, Kotlin, and Gradle.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/charging-tracker.git

* Replace `https://github.com/your-username/charging-tracker.git` with the actual URL of your
  repository.

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Launch Android Studio.
    * Select "Open an Existing Project."
    * Navigate to the cloned directory and select it.

3. **Build and Run:**
    * Wait for Gradle to sync the project.
    * Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
    * Click the "Run" button to build and install the app.
